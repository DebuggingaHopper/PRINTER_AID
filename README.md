#  What is Printer Aid

The Printer Aid was the prototype of a little tool I wanted to create to quickly clear the printer queue for a client through the click of a button.

## Limitations of this program
This program has a huge limitation whcih is that it relies on the user knowing what printer needs to be cleared and selecting it from the menu. This is a huge issue as the core philopshy of the Printer Aid was to remove any unnecessary work from the client. 

However this served as a good way to delve into something similar to the [processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=net-8.0) library which was used in its refined C# version.

## What happened to this project

This project was taken from python to C# to now currently have a production release and currently still being worked on. The C# .net program will be relased to thios GitHub profile once preparations have been made to take it from the private servers its currently hosted on.
